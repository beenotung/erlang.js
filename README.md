# erlang.js

## Basic Erlang and Node.js interoperability

Erlang.js is a simple JavaScript library to support the standard Erlang data encoding format (`term_to_binary`).

If you send data to an Erlang program, and that program will run `binary_to_term()`, then you need Erlang.js.

Erlang.js was spun off from production code used at Iris Couch. Erlang.js is available as an npm module.

    npm install erlang

## Examples

So far, only `term_to_binary` is implemented. Pass a data structure to `term_to_binary()` and it will return a Node.js buffer of that data, encoded.

## Data Types

Some data types encode as you would expect: numbers, arrays, and booleans.

But Erlang has foreign data types. Erlang.js supports a simple mechanism to represent those in JavaScript.

### Strings

JavaScript strings are converted to Erlang strings (i.e. lists of integers).

```javascript
term_to_binary("I am a string") // Encodes the Erlang string "I am a string"
```

### Atoms

`{atom:"Foo"}` encodes as Erlang `'Foo'`. You can also use a shorthand, `{a:"Foo"}`.

```javascript
term_to_binary({a:"POST"}) // Encodes the atom 'POST'
```

### Binaries

`{binary:"Foo"}` encodes as Erlang `<<"Foo">>`. You can also use a shorthand, `{b:"Foo"}`.

```javascript
term_to_binary({b:"POST"}) // Encodes the binary <<"POST">>
```

### Tuples

`{tuple:["foo", "bar"]}` encodes as Erlang `{"foo", "bar"}`. You can also use a shorthand, `{t:["foo", "bar"]}`.

```javascript
var foo = {a:"foo"} // an atom
term_to_binary({t:[foo, "bar"]}) // Encodes the tuple {foo, "bar"}
```

## Optlists

In JavaScript, if an API has tons of options, it tends to use an object.

```javascript
// An API with so many options it uses a single object argument:
request({url:"http://jsonip.com", json:true}, my_callback)
```

Erlang does not have this (for one thing, all data is always immutable). Instead it uses option lists (optlists) of mostly atoms and tagged tuples.

```erlang
Options = [set, public, {keypos, 1}, {write_concurrency, true}, compressed],
ets:new(my_table, Options).
```

Optlists are common in Erlang. You can build them manually with `term_to_binary()`, but the data structure is messy and distracting. Erlang.js provides an alternative, `optlist_to_binary()` which encodes more readable and obvious JavaScript data structures.

`optlist_to_binary()` encodes its arguments as an array. Each argument must be:

1. A short string (all-lowercase, up to 255 characters): converted to an atom
2. A 2-array where the first element is a short string: converted to a tagged tuple
3. An object with only one key/val pair: converted to a tagged tuple

To encode the optlist from the above Erlang example:

```javascript
optlist_to_binary('set', 'public', ['keypos', 1], {write_concurrency:true}, 'compressed')

/* Same as
term_to_binary([ { atom: 'set' }
               , { atom: 'public' }
               , { tuple: [ { atom: 'keypos' }, 1 ] }
               , { tuple: [ { atom: 'write_concurrency' }, true ] }
               , { atom: 'compressed' }
               ])
*/
```

## TODO
1. Use Symbol for the Atom

    `Symbol.for('atom')` is better than `{a:'atom'}`

2. handle Object.keys(o) and  Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(o) correctly

3. update test config to support ES6 (for Symbol to work)
